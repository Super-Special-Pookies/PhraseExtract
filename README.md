# PhraseExtract

This project is used for distributed phrase extract based on a mature tokenizer: IkAnalyzer. We mainly use Map-Reduce to construct the pipeline, a version of spark is on the way.



## How to use 

We use maven to manage dependencies. The version in detail can be found in pom.xml. 

A mature tokenizer needs to be installed in your local Maven Repository. A easy tutorial is supported here: https://github.com/wks/ik-analyzer .
